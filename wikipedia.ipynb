      "Insuranceis a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. It is a form ofrisk management, primarily used to protect against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n",
      "An entity which provides insurance is known as aninsurer,insurance company,insurance carrier, orunderwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as apolicyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called aninsured. The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has aninsurable interestestablished by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.\n",
      "The insured receives acontract, called theinsurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured, or their designated beneficiary or assignee. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called thepremium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by aclaims adjuster. A mandatoryout-of-pocket expenserequired by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called adeductible(or if required by ahealth insurancepolicy, acopayment). The insurer mayhedgeits own risk by taking outreinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.\n",
      "Methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced byChineseandIndiantraders as long ago as the3rdand2ndmillenniaBC, respectively.[1][2]Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel capsizing.\n",
      "Codex HammurabiLaw 238(c. 1755–1750 BC) stipulated that asea captain,ship-manager, orship chartererthat saved a ship fromtotal losswasonly required to pay one-half the value of the shipto theship-owner.[3][4][5]In theDigesta seu Pandectae(533), the second volume of thecodification of laws orderedbyJustinian I(527–565), alegal opinionwritten by theRoman juristPaulusin 235 AD was included about theLex Rhodia(\"Rhodian law\"). It articulates thegeneral averageprinciple ofmarine insuranceestablished on the island ofRhodesin approximately 1000 to 800 BC, plausibly by thePhoeniciansduring the proposedDorian invasionand emergence of the purportedSea Peoplesduring theGreek Dark Ages(c. 1100–c. 750).[6][7][8]\n",
      "The law of general average is the fundamentalprinciplethat underlies all insurance.[7]In 1816, an archeological excavation inMinya, Egyptproduced aNerva–Antonine dynasty-eratabletfrom the ruins of theTemple of AntinousinAntinoöpolis,Aegyptus. The tabletprescribed the rulesandmembership duesof aburial societycollegiumestablished inLanuvium,Italiain approximately 133 AD during the reign ofHadrian(117–138) of theRoman Empire.[7]In 1851 AD, futureU.S. Supreme CourtAssociate JusticeJoseph P. Bradley(1870–1892 AD), once employed as anactuaryfor theMutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, submitted an article to theJournal of the Institute of Actuaries. His article detailed an historical account of aSeveran dynasty-eralife tablecompiled by theRoman juristUlpianin approximately 220 AD that was also included in theDigesta.[9]\n",
      "Concepts of insurance has been also found in 3rd century BC Hindu scriptures such asDharmasastra,ArthashastraandManusmriti.[10]The ancient Greeks had marine loans. Money was advanced on a ship or cargo, to be repaid with large interest if the voyage prospers. However, the money would not be repaid at all if the ship were lost, thus making the rate of interest high enough to pay for not only for the use of the capital but also for the risk of losing it (fully described byDemosthenes). Loans of this character have ever since been common in maritime lands under the name ofbottomryand respondentia bonds.[11]\n",
      "The direct insurance of sea-risks for a premium paid independently of loans began inBelgiumabout 1300 AD.[11]\n",
      "Separate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented inGenoain the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from Genoa in 1347. In the next century, maritime insurance developed widely, and premiums were varied with risks.[12]These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful inmarine insurance.\n",
      "The earliest known policy of life insurance was made in theRoyal Exchange, London, on the 18th of June 1583, for £383, 6s. 8d. for twelve months on the life of William Gibbons.[11]\n",
      "Insurance became far more sophisticated inEnlightenment-eraEurope, where specialized varieties developed.\n",
      "Property insuranceas we know it today can be traced to theGreat Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance \"from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in SirChristopher Wren's inclusion of a site for \"the Insurance Office\" in his new plan for London in 1667.\"[13]A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681,economistNicholas Barbonand eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the \"Insurance Office for Houses\", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office.[14]\n",
      "At the same time, the first insurance schemes for theunderwritingofbusiness venturesbecame available. By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growth as a centre for trade was increasing due to the demand formarine insurance. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd openeda coffee house, which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, including those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance marketLloyd's of Londonand several related shipping and insurance businesses.[15]\n",
      "Life insurancepolicies were taken out in the early 18th century. The first company to offer life insurance was theAmicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, founded in London in 1706 byWilliam TalbotandSir Thomas Allen.[16][17]Upon the same principle,Edward Rowe Moresestablished theSociety for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorshipin 1762.\n",
      "It was the world's firstmutual insurerand it pioneered age based premiums based onmortality ratelaying \"the framework for scientific insurance practice and development\" and \"the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently based.\"[18]\n",
      "In the late 19th century \"accident insurance\" began to become available.[19]The first company to offer accident insurance was the Railway Passengers Assurance Company, formed in 1848 in England to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascentrailwaysystem.\n",
      "The first international insurance rule was theYork Antwerp Rules(YAR) for the distribution of costs between ship and cargo in the event of general average. In 1873 the \"Association for the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations\", the forerunner of theInternational Law Association(ILA), was founded in Brussels. It published the first YAR in 1890, before switching to the present title of the \"International Law Association\" in 1895.[20][21]\n",
      "By the late 19th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and old age.Germanybuilt on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s ChancellorOtto von Bismarckintroduced old age pensions, accident insurance and medical care that formed the basis for Germany'swelfare state.[22][23]In Britain more extensive legislation was introduced by theLiberalgovernment in the1911 National Insurance Act. This gave the British working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment.[24]This system was greatly expanded after theSecond World Warunder the influence of theBeveridge Report, to form the first modernwelfare state.[22][25]\n",
      "In 2008, the International Network of Insurance Associations (INIA), then an informal network, became active and it has been succeeded by theGlobal Federation of Insurance Associations(GFIA), which was formally founded in 2012 to aim to increase insurance industry effectiveness in providing input to international regulatory bodies and to contribute more effectively to the international dialogue on issues of common interest. It consists of its 40 member associations and 1 observer association in 67 countries, which companies account for around 89% of total insurance premiums worldwide.[26]\n",
      "Insurance involvespoolingfunds frommanyinsured entities (known as exposures) to pay for the losses that only some insureds may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be aninsurable risk, the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as afinancial intermediaryis a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities can alsoself-insurethrough saving money for possible future losses.[27]\n",
      "Risk which can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics:[28]\n",
      "When a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:[29]\n",
      "To \"indemnify\" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly,life insuranceis generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather \"contingent\" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:\n",
      "From an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.\n",
      "If the Insured has a \"reimbursement\" policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be \"reimbursed\" by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses.[30][note 1]\n",
      "Under a \"pay on behalf\" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of \"pay on behalf\" language, which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.\n",
      "Under an \"indemnification\" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either \"reimburse\" or \"pay on behalf of\", whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.\n",
      "An entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the \"insured\" party once risk is assumed by an \"insurer\", the insuring party, by means of acontract, called aninsurance policy. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), andexclusions(events not covered). An insured is thus said to be \"indemnified\" against the loss covered in the policy.\n",
      "When insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and foroverheadcosts. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer'sprofit.\n",
      "Policies typically include a number of exclusions, for example:\n",
      "Insurers may prohibit certain activities which are considered dangerous and therefore excluded from coverage. One system for classifying activities according to whether they are authorised by insurers refers to \"green light\" approved activities and events, \"yellow light\" activities and events which require insurer consultation and/or waivers of liability, and \"red light\" activities and events which are prohibited and outside the scope of insurance cover.[33]\n",
      "Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.\n",
      "Insurance can influence the probability of losses throughmoral hazard,insurance fraud, and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically usedmoral hazardto refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.[34]Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as throughbuilding codes.[35]\n",
      "According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:\n",
      "Insurers may use thesubscription business model, collecting premium payments periodically in return for on-going and/orcompoundingbenefits offered to policyholders.\n",
      "Insurers' business model aims to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:\n",
      "Insurers make money in two ways:\n",
      "The most complicated aspect of insuring is theactuarial scienceof ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which usesstatisticsandprobabilityto approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.\n",
      "At the most basic level, initial rate-making involves looking at thefrequencyandseverityof insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss-data, bring the loss data topresent value, and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy.[36]Loss ratiosand expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves—at the most basic level—comparing the losses with \"loss relativities\"—a policy with twice as many losses would, therefore, be charged twice as much. More complexmultivariate analysesare sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.\n",
      "Upon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer'sunderwriting profiton that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the \"combined ratio\", which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.[37]A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.\n",
      "Insurance companies earninvestmentprofits on \"float\". Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. TheAssociation of British Insurers(grouping together 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in theLondon Stock Exchange.[38]In 2007, U.S. industry profits from float totaled $58 billion. In a 2009 letter to investors, Warren Buffett wrote, \"we werepaid$2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008\".[39]\n",
      "In theUnited States, the underwriting loss ofpropertyandcasualty insurancecompanies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance-industry insiders, most notablyHank Greenberg, do not believe that it is possible to sustain a profit from float forever without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies \"investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance\".[40]\n",
      "Naturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in aneconomically depressedperiod.Bear marketsdo cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance-premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known[by whom?]as theunderwriting, or insurance, cycle.[41]\n",
      "Claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual \"product\" paid for. Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or throughbrokers or agents. The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced byACORD.\n",
      "Insurance-company claims departments employ a large number ofclaims adjusters, supported by a staff ofrecords-managementanddata-entry clerks. Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters, whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. An adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract (and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim), and authorizes payment.\n",
      "Policyholders may hire their ownpublic adjustersto negotiate settlements with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance-policy add-on, called loss-recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.\n",
      "Adjusting liability-insurance claims is particularly difficult because they involve a third party, theplaintiff, who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as adeep pocket. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured—either inside (\"house\") counsel or outside (\"panel\") counsel, monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement-conference when requested by a judge.\n",
      "If a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, thecondition of averagemay come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.\n",
      "In managing the claims-handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages. In addition to this balancing act,fraudulent insurance practicesare a majorbusiness riskthat insurers must manage and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims-handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation (seeinsurance bad faith).\n",
      "Insurers will often useinsurance agentsto initially market orunderwritetheir customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to the availability of improved and personalised services. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs, etc.) to market their products.[42]\n",
      "Any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example,vehicle insurancewould typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from anaccident). Ahome insurancepolicy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.\n",
      "Businessinsurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity (PI), which are discussed below under that name; and thebusiness owner's policy(BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.[43]\n",
      "Vehicle insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own, such as in atraffic collision.\n",
      "Coverage typically includes:\n",
      "Gap insurance covers the excess amount on an auto loan in an instance where the policyholder's insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put lowdown payments, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.\n",
      "Health insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid through taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.\n",
      "Casualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.\n",
      "Life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or anannuity. In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.\n",
      "Annuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities andpensionsthat pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that aretireewill outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.\n",
      "Certain life insurance contracts accumulatecashvalues, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities andendowment policies, are financial instruments to accumulate orliquidatewealthwhen it is needed.\n",
      "In many countries, such as the United States and the UK, thetax lawprovides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method ofsavingas well as protection in the event of early death.\n",
      "In the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived fromtax deferralmay be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.\n",
      "Burial insurance is an old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of afuneral. TheGreeksandRomansintroduced burial insurance c. 600 CE when they organizedguildscalled \"benevolent societies\" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in theMiddle Agesserved a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.\n",
      "Property insurance provides protection against risks to property, such asfire,theftorweatherdamage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance,flood insurance,earthquake insurance,home insurance, inland marine insurance orboiler insurance.\n",
      "The termproperty insurancemay, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:\n",
      "Liability insurance is a broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.\n",
      "Often a commercial insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers. The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy. Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insurer to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured. In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure. Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including \"stand-alone\" excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), \"follow form\" excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and \"umbrella\" insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).[50]\n",
      "Credit insurance repays some or all of aloanwhen the borrower is insolvent.\n",
      "Cyber-insuranceis a business lines insurance product intended to provide coverage to corporations from Internet-basedrisks, and more generally from risks relating toinformation technologyinfrastructure,information privacy, information governance liability, and activities related thereto.\n",
      "Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance among themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number ofreligiousgroups, including theAmishand someMuslimgroups, depend on support provided by theircommunitieswhendisastersstrike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work. In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking themoral hazardof explicit insurance contracts.\n",
      "In theUnited Kingdom,The Crown(which, for practical purposes, meant thecivil service) did not insure property such as government buildings. If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums. Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back, this arrangement is now less common.\n",
      "In the United States, the most prevalent form ofself-insuranceis governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form arisk pool. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise. Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.[57]\n",
      "Insurance companies may provide any combination of insurance types, but are often classified into three groups:[58]\n",
      "General insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.\n",
      "In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and differenttaxandaccountingrules. The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is long-term in nature – coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over manydecades. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.\n",
      "Insurance companies are commonly classified as eithermutualor proprietary companies.[59]Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance companies.\n",
      "Demutualizationof mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.\n",
      "Reinsurancecompanies are insurance companies that provide policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from substantial losses.[60]The reinsurance market is dominated by a few large companies with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.\n",
      "Captive insurancecompanies can be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a \"pure\" entity, which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company; of a \"mutual\" captive, which insures the collective risks of members of an industry; and of an \"association\" captive, which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association. Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.\n",
      "The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.\n",
      "Captives are becoming an increasingly important component of therisk managementand risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:\n",
      "Other possible forms for an insurance company includereciprocals, in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.[61]\n",
      "Admitted insurance companies are those in the United States that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency. The insurance they provide is calledadmitted insurance. Non-admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency, but are allowed to provide insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet.[62]\n",
      "There are also companies known as \"insurance consultants\". Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy among many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an \"insurance broker\" also shops around for the best insurance policy among many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.\n",
      "Neither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies. These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.\n",
      "The financial stability and strength of an insurance company is a consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future. For that reason, a more financially stable insurance carrier reduces the risk of the insurance company becoming insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangements with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.\n",
      "Insurance companies are rated by various agencies such asAM Best. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.\n",
      "Advanced economies account for the bulk of the global insurance industry. According toSwiss Re, the global insurance market wrote $6.287 trillion in direct premiums in 2020.[63](\"Direct premiums\" means premiums written directly by insurers before accounting for ceding of risk to reinsurers.) As usual, the United States was the country with the largest insurance market with $2.530 trillion (40.3%) of direct premiums written, with the People's Republic of China coming in second at only $574 billion (9.3%), Japan coming in third at $438 billion (7.1%), and the United Kingdom coming in fourth at $380 billion (6.2%).[63]However, theEuropean Union'ssingle marketis the actual second largest market, with 18 percent market share.[63]\n",
      "In the United States, insurance is regulated by the states under theMcCarran–Ferguson Act, with \"periodic proposals for federal intervention\", and a nonprofit coalition of state insurance agencies called theNational Association of Insurance Commissionersworks to harmonize the country's different laws and regulations.[64]The National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) also works to harmonize the different state laws.[65]\n",
      "In theEuropean Union, the Third Non-Life Directive and the Third Life Directive, both passed in 1992 and effective 1994, created a single insurance market in Europe and allowed insurance companies to offer insurance anywhere in the EU (subject to permission from authority in the head office) and allowed insurance consumers to purchase insurance from any insurer in the EU.[66]As far asinsurance in the United Kingdom, theFinancial Services Authoritytook over insurance regulation from the General Insurance Standards Council in 2005;[67]laws passed include the Insurance Companies Act 1973 and another in 1982,[68]and reforms towarrantyand other aspects under discussion as of 2012[update].[69]\n",
      "Theinsurance industry in Chinawas nationalized in 1949 and thereafter offered by only a single state-owned company, thePeople's Insurance Company of China, which was eventually suspended as demand declined in a communist environment. In 1978, market reforms led to an increase in the market and by 1995 a comprehensive Insurance Law of the People's Republic of China[70]was passed, followed in 1998 by the formation ofChina Insurance Regulatory Commission(CIRC), which has broad regulatory authority over the insurance market of China.[71]\n",

      "In 2017, within the framework of the joint project of theBank of RussiaandYandex, a specialcheck mark(a green circle with a tick and 'Реестр ЦБ РФ' (Unified state register of insurance entities) text box) appeared in the search for Yandex system, informing the consumer that the company's financial services are offered on the marked website, which has the status of an insurance company, a broker or a mutual insurance association.[72]\n",
      "Insurance is just a risk transfer mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity (i.e., an insurance company) by way of paying premiums. This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured. The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform arisk assessmentwhen writing the policy.\n",
      "As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim. However, premiums might reduce if the policyholder commits to a risk management program as recommended by the insurer.[73]It is therefore important that insurers view risk management as a joint initiative between policyholder and insurer since a robust risk management plan minimizes the possibility of a large claim for the insurer while stabilizing or reducing premiums for the policyholder.\n",
      "If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance. However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions. Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.[citation needed]\n",
      "An insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer), a concept known asmoral hazard. This 'insulates' many from the true costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentiallymaladaptive.[74]\n",
      "Insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may beadvertisedand sold.\n",
      "For example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted inplain English; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.\n",
      "Many institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted toward encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to \"shop\" themarketfor the best rates and coverage possible.\n",
      "Insurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.\n",
      "An independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.\n",
      "In the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select highdeductiblesand to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies frommoral hazard.[75]\n",
      "Redliningis the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination.Racial profilingorredlininghas a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.[76]\n",
      "In July 2007, the USFederal Trade Commission(FTC) released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-basedinsurance scoresin automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers.[77]The report was disputed by representatives of theConsumer Federation of America, the National Fair Housing Alliance, theNational Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.[78]\n",
      "All states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.[79]\n",
      "In determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location,credit scores,gender,occupation,marital status, andeducationlevel. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfullydiscriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.\n",
      "An insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.[citation needed]Thus, \"discrimination\" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting.[citation needed]For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: older people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore therisk premiummust be higher to cover the greater risk.[citation needed]However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.\n",

Early versions were independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company,Progressive Auto Insurance(U.S. Patent 5,797,134) and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez.[80]\n",
      "Many independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market. Independent inventors account for 70% of the new U.S. patent applications in this area.\n",
      "Many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them.The Hartfordinsurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.\n",
      "There are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States. The rate at which patents have been issued has steadily risen from 15 in 2002 to 44 in 2006.[81]\n",

      "Insurance on demand (also IoD) is an insurance service that provides clients with insurance protection when they need, i.e. only episodic rather than on24/7basis as typically provided by traditional insurers (e.g. clients can purchase an insurance for one single flight rather than a longer-lasting travel insurance plan).\n",
      "Certain insurance products and practices have been described asrent-seekingby critics.[citation needed]That is, some insurance products or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events.\n",
      "Muslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance. Life insurance policies that earn interest (or guaranteed bonus/NAV) are generally considered to be a form ofriba(usury) and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form ofgharar(speculation).

      "\n",
      "Insuranceis a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. It is a form ofrisk management, primarily used to protect against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n",
      "An entity which provides insurance is known as aninsurer,insurance company,insurance carrier, orunderwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as apolicyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called aninsured. The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has aninsurable interestestablished by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.\n",
      "The insured receives acontract, called theinsurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured, or their designated beneficiary or assignee. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called thepremium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by aclaims adjuster. A mandatoryout-of-pocket expenserequired by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called adeductible(or if required by ahealth insurancepolicy, acopayment). The insurer mayhedgeits own risk by taking outreinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.\n",
      "Methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced byChineseandIndiantraders as long ago as the3rdand2ndmillenniaBC, respectively.[1][2]Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel capsizing.\n",

It articulates thegeneral averageprinciple ofmarine insuranceestablished on the island ofRhodesin approximately 1000 to 800 BC, plausibly by thePhoeniciansduring the proposedDorian invasionand emergence of the purportedSea Peoplesduring theGreek Dark Ages(c. 1100–c. 750).[6][7][8]\n",

      "Concepts of insurance has been also found in 3rd century BC Hindu scriptures such asDharmasastra,ArthashastraandManusmriti.[10]The ancient Greeks had marine loans. Money was advanced on a ship or cargo, to be repaid with large interest if the voyage prospers. However, the money would not be repaid at all if the ship were lost, thus making the rate of interest high enough to pay for not only for the use of the capital but also for the risk of losing it (fully described byDemosthenes). Loans of this character have ever since been common in maritime lands under the name ofbottomryand respondentia bonds.[11]\n",
      "The direct insurance of sea-risks for a premium paid independently of loans began inBelgiumabout 1300 AD.[11]\n",
      "Separate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented inGenoain the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from Genoa in 1347. In the next century, maritime insurance developed widely, and premiums were varied with risks.[12]These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful inmarine insurance.\n",
      "The earliest known policy of life insurance was made in theRoyal Exchange, London, on the 18th of June 1583, for £383, 6s. 8d. for twelve months on the life of William Gibbons.[11]\n",
      "Insurance became far more sophisticated inEnlightenment-eraEurope, where specialized varieties developed.\n",
      "Property insuranceas we know it today can be traced to theGreat Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance \"from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in SirChristopher Wren's inclusion of a site for \"the Insurance Office\" in his new plan for London in 1667.\"[13]A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681,economistNicholas Barbonand eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the \"Insurance Office for Houses\", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office.[14]\n",
      "At the same time, the first insurance schemes for theunderwritingofbusiness venturesbecame available. By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growth as a centre for trade was increasing due to the demand formarine insurance. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd openeda coffee house, which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, including those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance marketLloyd's of Londonand several related shipping and insurance businesses.[15]\n",
      "Life insurancepolicies were taken out in the early 18th century. The first company to offer life insurance was theAmicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, founded in London in 1706 byWilliam TalbotandSir Thomas Allen.[16][17]Upon the same principle,Edward Rowe Moresestablished theSociety for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorshipin 1762.\n",

      "The first international insurance rule was theYork Antwerp Rules(YAR) for the distribution of costs between ship and cargo in the event of general average. In 1873 the \"Association for the Reform and Codification of the Law of Nations\", the forerunner of theInternational Law Association(ILA), was founded in Brussels. It published the first YAR in 1890, before switching to the present title of the \"International Law Association\" in 1895.[20][21]\n",
      "By the late 19th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and old age.Germanybuilt on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as in the 1840s. In the 1880s ChancellorOtto von Bismarckintroduced old age pensions, accident insurance and medical care that formed the basis for Germany'swelfare state.[22][23]In Britain more extensive legislation was introduced by theLiberalgovernment in the1911 National Insurance Act. This gave the British working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment.[24]This system was greatly expanded after theSecond World Warunder the influence of theBeveridge Report, to form the first modernwelfare state.[22][25]\n",
      "In 2008, the International Network of Insurance Associations (INIA), then an informal network, became active and it has been succeeded by theGlobal Federation of Insurance Associations(GFIA), which was formally founded in 2012 to aim to increase insurance industry effectiveness in providing input to international regulatory bodies and to contribute more effectively to the international dialogue on issues of common interest. It consists of its 40 member associations and 1 observer association in 67 countries, which companies account for around 89% of total insurance premiums worldwide.[26]\n",

Accordingly,life insuranceis generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather \"contingent\" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:\n",
      "From an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.\n",
      "If the Insured has a \"reimbursement\" policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be \"reimbursed\" by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses.[30][note 1]\n",
      "Under a \"pay on behalf\" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of \"pay on behalf\" language, which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.\n",
      "Under an \"indemnification\" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either \"reimburse\" or \"pay on behalf of\", whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.\n",
      "An entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the \"insured\" party once risk is assumed by an \"insurer\", the insuring party, by means of acontract, called aninsurance policy. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), andexclusions(events not covered). An insured is thus said to be \"indemnified\" against the loss covered in the policy.\n",
      "When insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims – in theory for a relatively few claimants – and foroverheadcosts. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer'sprofit.\n",
      "Policies typically include a number of exclusions, for example:\n",
      "Insurers may prohibit certain activities which are considered dangerous and therefore excluded from coverage. One system for classifying activities according to whether they are authorised by insurers refers to \"green light\" approved activities and events, \"yellow light\" activities and events which require insurer consultation and/or waivers of liability, and \"red light\" activities and events which are prohibited and outside the scope of insurance cover.[33]\n",
      "Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.\n",
      "Insurance can influence the probability of losses throughmoral hazard,insurance fraud, and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically usedmoral hazardto refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.[34]Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures—particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes—because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as throughbuilding codes.[35]\n",
      "According to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:\n",
      "Insurers may use thesubscription business model, collecting premium payments periodically in return for on-going and/orcompoundingbenefits offered to policyholders.\n",
      "Insurers' business model aims to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:\n",
      "Insurers make money in two ways:\n",
      "The most complicated aspect of insuring is theactuarial scienceof ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which usesstatisticsandprobabilityto approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.\n",
      "At the most basic level, initial rate-making involves looking at thefrequencyandseverityof insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss-data, bring the loss data topresent value, and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy.[36]Loss ratiosand expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves—at the most basic level—comparing the losses with \"loss relativities\"—a policy with twice as many losses would, therefore, be charged twice as much. More complexmultivariate analysesare sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.\n",
      "Upon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer'sunderwriting profiton that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the \"combined ratio\", which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.[37]A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.\n",
      "Insurance companies earninvestmentprofits on \"float\". Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. TheAssociation of British Insurers(grouping together 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in theLondon Stock Exchange.[38]In 2007, U.S. industry profits from float totaled $58 billion. In a 2009 letter to investors, Warren Buffett wrote, \"we werepaid$2.8 billion to hold our float in 2008\".[39]\n",
      "In theUnited States, the underwriting loss ofpropertyandcasualty insurancecompanies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance-industry insiders, most notablyHank Greenberg, do not believe that it is possible to sustain a profit from float forever without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Reliance on float for profit has led some industry experts to call insurance companies \"investment companies that raise the money for their investments by selling insurance\".[40]\n",
      "Naturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in aneconomically depressedperiod.Bear marketsdo cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance-premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known[by whom?]as theunderwriting, or insurance, cycle.[41]\n",
      "Claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual \"product\" paid for. Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or throughbrokers or agents. The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced byACORD.\n",
      "Insurance-company claims departments employ a large number ofclaims adjusters, supported by a staff ofrecords-managementanddata-entry clerks. Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters, whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. An adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract (and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim), and authorizes payment.\n",
      "Policyholders may hire their ownpublic adjustersto negotiate settlements with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance-policy add-on, called loss-recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.\n",
      "Adjusting liability-insurance claims is particularly difficult because they involve a third party, theplaintiff, who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as adeep pocket. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured—either inside (\"house\") counsel or outside (\"panel\") counsel, monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement-conference when requested by a judge.\n",
      "If a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, thecondition of averagemay come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.\n",
      "In managing the claims-handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages. In addition to this balancing act,fraudulent insurance practicesare a majorbusiness riskthat insurers must manage and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims-handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation (seeinsurance bad faith).\n",
      "Insurers will often useinsurance agentsto initially market orunderwritetheir customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to the availability of improved and personalised services. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs, etc.) to market their products.[42]\n",
      "Any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example,vehicle insurancewould typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from anaccident). Ahome insurancepolicy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.\n",
      "Businessinsurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity (PI), which are discussed below under that name; and thebusiness owner's policy(BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.[43]\n",
      "Vehicle insurance protects the policyholder against financial loss in the event of an incident involving a vehicle they own, such as in atraffic collision.\n",
      "Coverage typically includes:\n",
      "Gap insurance covers the excess amount on an auto loan in an instance where the policyholder's insurance company does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put lowdown payments, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.\n",
      "Health insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid through taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.\n",
      "Casualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.\n",
      "Life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or anannuity. In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.\n",
      "Annuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities andpensionsthat pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that aretireewill outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.\n",
      "Certain life insurance contracts accumulatecashvalues, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities andendowment policies, are financial instruments to accumulate orliquidatewealthwhen it is needed.\n",
      "In many countries, such as the United States and the UK, thetax lawprovides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method ofsavingas well as protection in the event of early death.\n",
      "In the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived fromtax deferralmay be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.\n",
      "Burial insurance is an old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of afuneral. TheGreeksandRomansintroduced burial insurance c. 600 CE when they organizedguildscalled \"benevolent societies\" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in theMiddle Agesserved a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.\n",
      "Property insurance provides protection against risks to property, such asfire,theftorweatherdamage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance,flood insurance,earthquake insurance,home insurance, inland marine insurance orboiler insurance.\n",
      "The termproperty insurancemay, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:\n",
      "Liability insurance is a broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.\n",
      "Often a commercial insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers. The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy. Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insurer to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured. In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure. Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including \"stand-alone\" excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), \"follow form\" excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and \"umbrella\" insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).[50]\n",
      "Credit insurance repays some or all of aloanwhen the borrower is insolvent.\n",
      "Cyber-insuranceis a business lines insurance product intended to provide coverage to corporations from Internet-basedrisks, and more generally from risks relating toinformation technologyinfrastructure,information privacy, information governance liability, and activities related thereto.\n",
      "Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance among themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number ofreligiousgroups, including theAmishand someMuslimgroups, depend on support provided by theircommunitieswhendisastersstrike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work. In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking themoral hazardof explicit insurance contracts.\n",
      "In theUnited Kingdom,The Crown(which, for practical purposes, meant thecivil service) did not insure property such as government buildings. If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums. Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies and rented back, this arrangement is now less common.\n",
      "In the United States, the most prevalent form ofself-insuranceis governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts. Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form arisk pool. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise. Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools. Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.[57]\n",
      "Insurance companies may provide any combination of insurance types, but are often classified into three groups:[58]\n",
      "General insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.\n",
      "In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and differenttaxandaccountingrules. The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is long-term in nature – coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over manydecades. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.\n",
      "Insurance companies are commonly classified as eithermutualor proprietary companies.[59]Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance companies.\n",
      "Demutualizationof mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.\n",
      "Reinsurancecompanies are insurance companies that provide policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from substantial losses.[60]The reinsurance market is dominated by a few large companies with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.\n",
      "Captive insurancecompanies can be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a \"pure\" entity, which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company; of a \"mutual\" captive, which insures the collective risks of members of an industry; and of an \"association\" captive, which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association. Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.\n",
      "The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.\n",
      "Captives are becoming an increasingly important component of therisk managementand risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:\n",
      "Other possible forms for an insurance company includereciprocals, in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.[61]\n",
      "Admitted insurance companies are those in the United States that have been admitted or licensed by the state licensing agency. The insurance they provide is calledadmitted insurance. Non-admitted companies have not been approved by the state licensing agency, but are allowed to provide insurance under special circumstances when they meet an insurance need that admitted companies cannot or will not meet.[62]\n",
      "There are also companies known as \"insurance consultants\". Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy among many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an \"insurance broker\" also shops around for the best insurance policy among many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.\n",
      "Neither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies. These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.\n",
      "The financial stability and strength of an insurance company is a consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future. For that reason, a more financially stable insurance carrier reduces the risk of the insurance company becoming insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangements with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.\n",
      "Insurance companies are rated by various agencies such asAM Best. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.\n",
      "Advanced economies account for the bulk of the global insurance industry. According toSwiss Re, the global insurance market wrote $6.287 trillion in direct premiums in 2020.[63](\"Direct premiums\" means premiums written directly by insurers before accounting for ceding of risk to reinsurers.) As usual, the United States was the country with the largest insurance market with $2.530 trillion (40.3%) of direct premiums written, with the People's Republic of China coming in second at only $574 billion (9.3%), Japan coming in third at $438 billion (7.1%), and the United Kingdom coming in fourth at $380 billion (6.2%).[63]However, theEuropean Union'ssingle marketis the actual second largest market, with 18 percent market share.[63]\n",

      "In theEuropean Union, the Third Non-Life Directive and the Third Life Directive, both passed in 1992 and effective 1994, created a single insurance market in Europe and allowed insurance companies to offer insurance anywhere in the EU (subject to permission from authority in the head office) and allowed insurance consumers to purchase insurance from any insurer in the EU.[66]As far asinsurance in the United Kingdom, theFinancial Services Authoritytook over insurance regulation from the General Insurance Standards Council in 2005;[67]laws passed include the Insurance Companies Act 1973 and another in 1982,[68]and reforms towarrantyand other aspects under discussion as of 2012[update].[69]\n",

      "Insurance is just a risk transfer mechanism wherein the financial burden which may arise due to some fortuitous event is transferred to a bigger entity (i.e., an insurance company) by way of paying premiums. This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured. The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform arisk assessmentwhen writing the policy.\n",
      "As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim. However, premiums might reduce if the policyholder commits to a risk management program as recommended by the insurer.[73]It is therefore important that insurers view risk management as a joint initiative between policyholder and insurer since a robust risk management plan minimizes the possibility of a large claim for the insurer while stabilizing or reducing premiums for the policyholder.\n",
      "If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance. However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions. Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.[citation needed]\n",
      "An insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer), a concept known asmoral hazard. This 'insulates' many from the true costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentiallymaladaptive.[74]\n",
      "Insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may beadvertisedand sold.\n",
      "For example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted inplain English; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.\n",
      "Many institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted toward encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to \"shop\" themarketfor the best rates and coverage possible.\n",
      "Insurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.\n",
      "An independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.\n",
      "In the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select highdeductiblesand to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies frommoral hazard.[75]\n",
      "Redliningis the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination.Racial profilingorredlininghas a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.[76]\n",
      "In July 2007, the USFederal Trade Commission(FTC) released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-basedinsurance scoresin automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers.[77]The report was disputed by representatives of theConsumer Federation of America, the National Fair Housing Alliance, theNational Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.[78]\n",

      "In determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location,credit scores,gender,occupation,marital status, andeducationlevel. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfullydiscriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.\n",
      "An insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.[citation needed]Thus, \"discrimination\" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting.[citation needed]For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: older people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore therisk premiummust be higher to cover the greater risk.[citation needed]However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.\n",

      "Insurance fraudis any act committed todefraudan insurance process. It occurs when a claimant attempts to obtain some benefit or advantage they are not entitled to, or when an insurer knowingly denies some benefit that is due. According to the United StatesFederal Bureau of Investigation, the most common schemes include premium diversion, fee churning, asset diversion, and workers compensation fraud. Perpetrators in the schemes can be insurance company employees or claimants.[1]False insurance claimsareinsuranceclaims filed with thefraudulentintention towards an insurance provider.\n",
      "Insurance fraud has existed since the beginning of insurance as a commercial enterprise.[2]Fraudulent claims account for a significant portion of all claims received by insurers, and cost billions of dollars annually. Types of insurance fraud are diverse and occur in all areas of insurance.  Insurance crimes also range in severity, from slightly exaggerating claims to deliberately causing accidents or damage.  Fraudulent activities affect the lives of innocent people, both directly through accidental or intentional injury or damage, and indirectly by the crimes leading to higher insurance premiums. Insurance fraud poses a significant problem, and governments and other organizations try to deter such activity.\n",
      "Anepigramby the Roman poetMartialprovides a clear evidence the phenomenon of insurance fraud was already known in the Roman Empire during the First Century AD:[3]\n",
      "The \"chief motive in all insurance crimes is financial profit\".[2]Insurance contracts provide both the insured and the insurer with opportunities for exploitation.\n",
      "According to theCoalition Against Insurance Fraud, the causes vary, but are usually centered on greed, and on holes in the protections against fraud.[4]Often, those who commit insurance fraud view it as a low-risk, lucrative enterprise. For example, drug dealers who have entered insurance fraud[5]think it's safer and more profitable than working street corners. Compared to those for other crimes, court sentences for insurance fraud can be lenient, reducing the risk of extended punishment. Though insurers fight fraud, some pay suspicious claims anyway, as settling such claims is often cheaper than legal action\n",
      "Another basis for fraud is over-insurance, in which someone insures property for more than its real value.[2]This condition can be difficult to avoid, especially since an insurance provider might sometimes encourage it to obtain greater profits.[2]This lets fraudsters profit by destroying their property, because they receive an insurance payout greater that the value of the property.  The most common forms of insurance fraud are re-framing a non-insured damage to make it an event covered by insurance, and inflating the value of the loss.[6]\n",
      "It is hard to place an exact value on the money stolen through insurance fraud. Insurance fraud is deliberately undetectable, unlike visible crimes such as robbery or murder. As such, the number of cases of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed.[2]The best that can be done is to provide an estimate for the losses that insurers suffer due to insurance fraud.  TheCoalition Against Insurance Fraudestimates that in 2006 a total of about $80 billion was lost in theUnited Statesdue to insurance fraud.[7]According to estimates by theInsurance Information Institute, insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insurance industry's incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses.[8]The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that 3% of the health care industry's expenditures in the United States are due to fraudulent activities, amounting to a cost of about $51 billion.[9]Other estimates attribute as much as 10% of the total healthcare spending in the United States to fraud—about $115 billion annually.[10]According to the FBI, non-health insurance fraud costs an estimated $40 billion per year, which increases the premiums for the average U.S. family between $400 and $700 annually.[1]Another study of alltypes of fraudcommitted in the United States insurance institutions (property-and-casualty, business liability, healthcare, social security, etc.) put the true cost at 33% to 38% of the total cash flow through the system. This study resulted in the book titleThe Trillion Dollar Insurance Crookby J.E. Smith. In theUnited Kingdom, the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in theUnited Kingdomis about£1.5 billion ($3.08 billion), causing a 5% increase in insurance premiums.[11]TheInsurance Bureau of Canadaestimates that personal injury fraud inCanadacosts aboutC$500 million annually.[12]Indiaforensic Center of Studies estimates that Insurance frauds inIndiacosts about$6.25 billion annually.[13]\n",
      "Insurance fraud can be classified as either hard fraud or soft fraud.[14]\n",
      "Hard fraudoccurs when someone deliberately plans or invents a loss, such as a collision, auto theft, or fire that is covered by their insurance policy[15]in order to claim payment for damages. Criminal rings are sometimes involved in hard fraud schemes that can steal millions of dollars.[16]\n",
      "Soft fraud, which is far more common than hard fraud, is sometimes also referred to as opportunistic fraud.[14]This type of fraud consists of policyholders exaggerating otherwise legitimate claims. For example, when involved in an automotive collision an insured person might claim more damage than actually occurred. Soft fraud can also occur when, while obtaining a new healthinsurance policy, an individual misreports previous or existing conditions to obtain a lower premium on the insurance policy.[14]\n",
      "The majority of life insurance fraud occurs at the application stage, involving applicants misrepresenting their health, their income, and other personal information in order to get a cheaper premium. As more and more insurance amendments can be performed online or over the telephone, identity theft has become an enabling crime that can lead to the amendment of life insurance terms to benefit a fraudster; for example, by adding a second stolen identity as a new beneficiary.[citation needed]\n",
      "Life insurance fraud may involvefaking deathto claim life insurance. Fraudsters may sometimes turn up a few years after disappearing, claiming a loss of memory.[17]\n",
      "An example of life insurance fraud occurred in thecase of John Darwin, a former teacher and prison officer whoturned up alivein December 2007, five years after he was thought to have died in a canoeing accident, claiming to have no memory of the period after his disappearance.\n",
      "Similarly, formerBritish GovernmentministerJohn Stonehousewent missing in 1974 from a beach in Miami but was discovered living under an assumed name inAustralia. He was subsequentlyextraditedto Britain and imprisoned for seven years on charges of fraud, theft, and forgery.\n",
      "Another case would be that ofJack Gilbert Graham. He put a bomb on his mother's plane and purchased insurance before the flight took off.[18]\n",
      "Health insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of deceiving, concealing, or misrepresenting information that results in health care benefits being paid to an individual or group.\n",
      "Fraud can be committed either by an insured person or by a provider. Member fraud consists of claims on behalf of ineligible members and/or dependents, alterations on enrollment forms, concealing pre-existing conditions, failure to report other coverage,prescription drugfraud, and failure to disclose claims that were a result of a work-related injury.\n",
      "Provider fraud consists of claims submitted by bogus physicians, billing for services not rendered, billing for higher level of services,diagnosisor treatments that are outside the scope of practice, alterations on claims submissions, and providing services while medical licenses are either suspended or revoked.Independent medical examinationsdebunk false insurance claims and allow the insurance company or claimant to seek a non-partial medical view for injury-related cases.\n",
      "According to theCoalition Against Insurance Fraud, health insurance fraud depletes taxpayer-funded programs like Medicare, and may victimize patients in the hands of certain doctors.[19]Some scams involve double-billing by doctors who charge insurers for treatments that never occurred, and surgeons who perform unnecessary surgery.[20]\n",
      "According to Roger Feldman, Blue Cross Professor of Health Insurance at theUniversity of Minnesota, one of the main reasons that medical fraud is such a prevalent practice is that nearly all of the parties involved find it favorable in some way.  Manyphysicianssee it as necessary to provide quality care for their patients.  Many patients, although disapproving of the idea of fraud, are sometimes more willing to accept it when it affects their own medical care.  Program administrators are often lenient on the issue of insurance fraud, as they want to maximize the services of their providers.[21]\n",
      "The most common perpetrators of healthcare insurance fraud arehealth care providers.  One reason for this, according to David Hyman, a Professor at theUniversity of Maryland School of Law, is that the historically-prevailing attitude in the medical profession is one of \"fidelity to patients\".[22]This incentive can lead to fraudulent practices such as billing insurers for treatments that are not covered by the patient's insurance policy.  To do this, physicians bill for a different service that the policy covers, rather than the service they rendered.[23]\n",
      "Another motivation for insurance fraud is a desire for financial gain.  Public healthcare programs such asMedicareandMedicaidare especially conducive to fraudulent activities, as they are often run on afee-for-servicestructure.[24]Physicians use several fraudulent techniques to achieve this end.  These can include \"up-coding\" or \"upgrading\", which involve billing for more expensive treatments than those actually provided; providing, and subsequently billing for, treatments that are not medically necessary; scheduling extra visits for patients; referring patients to other physicians when no further treatment is actually necessary; \"phantom billing\", billing for services not rendered; and \"ganging\", billing for services to family members or other individuals who are accompanying the patient but who did not personally receive any services.[24]\n",
      "Perhaps the greatest total dollar amount of fraud is committed by the health insurance companies themselves. There are numerous studies and articles detailing examples of insurance companies intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems,[25]denying and cancelling coverage, and the blatant underpayment to hospitals and physicians beneath what are normal fees for care they provide.[26]Although difficult to obtain the information, this fraud by insurance companies can be estimated by comparing revenues from premium payments and expenditures on health claims.\n",
      "In response to the increased amount of health care fraud in the United States,Congress, through theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Actof 1996 (HIPAA), has specifically established health care fraud as a federalcriminal offensewith punishment of up to ten years of prison in addition to significant financial penalties.\n",
      "Fraud rings or groups may fake traffic deaths or stage collisions to make false insurance or exaggerated claims and collect insurance money. The ring may involve insurance claims adjusters and other people who create phony police reports to process claims.[27]\n",
      "TheInsurance Fraud Bureauin the UK estimated there were more than 20,000 staged collisions and false insurance claims across the UK from 1999 to 2006. One tactic fraudsters use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive into the back of them. They claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind them, and make a false and inflated claim to the motorist's insurer for whiplash and damage, which can pay the fraudsters up to £30,000.[28]In the Insurance Fraud Bureau's first year of operation, the usage ofdata mininginitiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a five-to-one return on investment.[29]\n",
      "TheInsurance Research Councilestimated that in 1996, 21 to 36 percent of auto-insurance claims contained elements of suspected fraud.[30]There is a wide variety of schemes used to defraud automobile insurance providers.  These ploys can differ greatly in complexity and severity.Richard A. Derrig, vice president of research for theInsurance Fraud Bureau of Massachusetts, lists several ways that auto-insurance fraud can occur,[31]such as:\n",
      "In staged collision fraud, fraudsters use a motor vehicle to stage an accident with the innocent party.  Typically, the fraudsters' vehicle carries four or five passengers.  Its driver makes an unexpected manoeuvre, forcing an innocent party to collide with the fraudster's vehicle. Each of the fraudsters then files claims for injuries sustained in the vehicle.  A \"recruited\" doctor diagnoses whiplash or other soft-tissue injuries that are hard to dispute later.\n",
      "Other examples include jumping in front of cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts do not like using verbal claims, most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.[32]\n",
      "A real accident may occur, but the dishonest owner may take the opportunity to incorporate a whole range of previous minor damage to the vehicle into the garage bill associated with the real accident. Personal injuries may also be exaggerated, particularlywhiplash.[33]Insurance fraud cases of exaggerated claims can also include claiming damage to the car that is not from the accident reported in the claim.[34]\n",
      "Examples ofsoft auto-insurance fraudinclude filing more than one claim for a single injury, filing claims for injuries not related to anautomobile accident, misreporting wage losses due to injuries, and reporting higher costs forcar repairsthan those that were actually paid.Hard auto-insurance fraudcan include activities such as staging automobile collisions, filing claims when the claimant was not actually involved in the accident, submitting claims for medical treatments that were not received, or inventing injuries.[35]Hard fraudcan also occur when claimants falsely report their vehicle as stolen.Soft fraudaccounts for the majority of fraudulent auto-insurance claims.[30]\n",
      "Another example is that a person may illegally register their car to a location that would net them cheaper insurance rates than where they actually live, sometimes calledrate evasion. For example, some drivers inBrooklynhavePennsylvania license plates, because insurance rates for a car registered to an address in ruralPennsylvaniaare much less than they are in Brooklyn. Another form ofautomobile insurance fraud, known as \"fronting\", involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of the car. For example, parents might list themselves as the primary driver of their children's vehicles to avoid young driver premiums.\n",
      "\"Crash for cash\" scams may involve random unaware strangers, set to appear as the perpetrators of the orchestrated crashes.[36]Such techniques are theclassic rear-end shunt(the driver in front suddenly slams on the brakes, possibly with brake lights disabled), thedecoy rear-end shunt(when following one car, another one pulls in front of it, causing it to brake sharply, then the first car drives off) or thehelpful wave shunt(the driver is waved into a line of queuing traffic by the scammer who promptly crashes, then denies waving).[37]\n",
      "Organized crimerings can also be involved in auto-insurance fraud, sometimes carrying out schemes that are very complex. An example of one such ploy is given byKen Dornstein, author ofAccidentally, on Purpose: The Making of a Personal Injury Underworld in America. In this scheme, known as a \"swoop-and-squat\", one or more drivers in \"swoop\" cars force an unsuspecting driver into position behind a \"squat\" car. This squat car, which is usually filled with several passengers, then slows abruptly, forcing the driver of the chosen car to collide with the squat car.  The passengers in the squat car then file a claim with the other driver's insurance company.  This claim often includes bills for medical treatments that were not necessary or not received.[38]\n",
      "An incident that took place onGolden State FreewayJune 17, 1992, brought public attention to the existence of organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud. These schemes generally consist of three different levels. At the top, there are the professionals—doctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries and/or file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud. Next are the \"cappers\" or \"runners\", the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash, farm out the claims to the professionals at the top, and recruit participants. These participants at the bottom-rung of the scheme are desperate people (poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash) who are paid around US$1000 to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks, playing a kind of Russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them. According to investigators, cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups. What makes busting thesestaged-accident crime ringsdifficult is how quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement, after a crackdown in a particular region. As a result, in the US several levels of police and theinsurance industryhave cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim histories.[39][40]\n",
      "In theUnited Kingdom, there is an increasing incidence of falsewhiplashclaims tocar insurancecompanies frommotoristsinvolved in minorcar accidents(for instance; a shunt). Because the mechanism of injury is not fully understood,A&Edoctors have to rely on apatient'sexternal symptoms (which are easy to fake). Resultingly, \"no win no fee\"personal injurysolicitorsexploit this \"loophole\" for easycompensationmoney (often a £2500 payout). Ultimately this has resulted in increasedmotor insurancepremiums, which has had theknock-on effectof pricing younger drivers off the road.\n",
      "Possible motivations for this can include obtaining payment that is worth more than the value of the property destroyed, or to destroy and subsequently receive payment for goods that could not otherwise be sold.  According to Alfred Manes, the majority of property insurance crimes involvearson.[41]One reason for this is that any evidence that a fire was started by arson is often destroyed by the fire itself.  According to theUnited States Fire Administration, in the United States there were approximately 31,000 fires caused by arson in 2006, resulting in losses of $755 million.[42]\n",
      "Unemployment insurance fraud can occur when someone who is not unemployed or who steals the identity of another individual obtains unemployment benefits to which he or she is not entitled. During 2020, there was a significant spike of unemployment fraud in the United States.[43]\n",
      "In addition to fraudulent claims, insurers can lose premium because customers inaccurately describe the risk, causing less premium to be charged. This can happen for any type of insurable risk and is most noteworthy in workers compensation insurance, where insureds report fewer employees, less payroll, and less risky employees than is actually intended to be covered by the policy.[44]\n",
      "The fraud involving claims from thecouncils' insurers suppose staging damages blamable on the local authorities (mostly falls and trips on council owned land) or inflating the value of existing damages.[45]\n",
      "The detection of insurance fraud generally occurs in two steps.  The first step is to identify suspicious claims that have a higher possibility of being fraudulent.  This can be done bycomputerizedstatisticalanalysis or by referrals fromclaims adjustersor insurance agents.  Additionally, the public can provide tips to insurance companies, law enforcement and other organizations regarding suspected, observed, or admitted insurance fraud perpetrated by other individuals. Regardless of the source, the next step is to refer these claims to investigators for further analysis.\n",
      "Due to the sheer number of claims submitted each day, it would be far too expensive for insurance companies to have employees check each claim for symptoms of fraud.[46]Instead, many companies use computers and statistical analysis to identify suspicious claims for further investigation.[47]There are two main types of statistical analysis tools used: supervised and unsupervised.[46]In both cases, suspicious claims are identified by comparing data about the claim to expected values.  The main difference between the two methods is how the expected values are derived.[46]\n",
      "In a supervised method, expected values are obtained by analyzing records of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.[46]According to Richard J. Bolton and David B. Hand, both of Imperial College in London, this method has some drawbacks as it requires absolute certainty that those claims analyzed are actually either fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and because it can only be used to detect types of fraud that have been committed and identified before.[46]\n",
      "Unsupervised methods of statistical detection, on the other hand, involve detecting claims that are abnormal.[46]Both claims adjusters and computers can also be trained to identify \"red flags\", or symptoms that in the past have often been associated with fraudulent claims.[48]Statistical detection does not prove that claims are fraudulent; it merely identifies suspicious claims that must be investigated further.[46]\n",
      "Fraudulent claims can be one of two types:[49]\n",
      "Once a built up claim is identified, insurance companies usually try to negotiate the claim down to the appropriate amount.[50]Suspicious claims can also be submitted to \"special investigative units\", or SIUs, for further investigation.  These units generally consist of experienced claims adjusters with special training in investigating fraudulent claims.[51]These investigators look for certain symptoms associated with fraudulent claims, or otherwise look for evidence of falsification of some kind.  This evidence can then be used to deny payment of the claims or to prosecute fraudsters if the violation is serious enough.[52]\n",
      "When an insurance company's fraud department investigates a fraud claim, they frequently proceed in two stages: pre-contact and post-contact.[53]In the pre-contact stage they analyze all available evidence before they contact the suspect.  They may review submitted paperwork, reach out to third parties, and gather evidence from available sources. Then, in the \"post-contact\" stage, they interview the suspect to gather more information and, ideally, obtain an incriminating statement. Insurance fraud investigators are trained to question the suspect in a way that precludes the suspect raising a valid defense at a later time. For example, questions about access to claim forms preclude the defense of another individual filling out the fraudulent documents. Common defenses that the suspect interview may preclude include the suspect lacking either the knowledge that their statement was false[54]or the intention to defraud,[55]or the suspect making an ambiguous statement that was later misinterpreted.[56]Full disclosure may add credibility to a suspect's account of events, but omissions from disclosure or false statements may detract from the suspect's credibility in later interviews or proceedings.[56]\n",
      "Within the context of health insurance, fraud by health insurance companies is sometimes found by comparing revenues from premiums paid against the expenditure by the health insurance companies on claims. For example, in 2006 the Harris County Medical Society, in Texas, had a health insurance rate increase of 22 percent for \"consumer-driven\" health plans from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas. This was despite the fact that during the previous year, Blue Cross had paid out only 9 percent of the collected premium dollars for claims.[26]\n",

      "TheInsurance Institute for Highway Safety and Highway Loss Data Institute(IIHS-HLDI) is an Americannonprofit organization. It was established in 1959, and it is noted for its safety reviews of vehicles in various simulated traffic situations, including the effectiveness of a vehicle's structural integrity and safety systems during a collision, in addition to examining improvement on such elements.[1]\n",
      "The IIHS was founded in 1959 by three separate insurance groups[which?]as a supporting entity to other academic and research organizations involving highway safety.[2]Russell Brown served as the inaugural president of the IIHS until 1968, when its board of governors changed the IIHS to an independent scientific organization. The following year, Physician William Haddon Jr. assumed the position of IIHS president after the change, and the IIHS began conducting crash tests starting with the low-speed bumper test.\n",
      "In 1972, theHighway Loss Data Institute(HLDI) was founded as a supporting organization to the IIHS, as was the latter's original purpose for other organizations. The HLDI compiles and publishes insurance loss statistics due to incidents such as traffic collisions and consequential damages depending on the vehicle type.[3]\n",
      "The IIHS and HLDI are interchangeably referred to as one entity (IIHS-HLDI) or separate entities by the organization itself.\n",
      "The IIHS evaluates six individual categories, assigning each a \"Good\", \"Acceptable\", \"Marginal\", or \"Poor\" rating before determining the vehicle's overall frontal impact rating.[5]\n",
      "The moderate overlap test (formerlyfrontal offset test), introduced in January 1995,[6]differs from that of the U.S. government'sNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA)New Car Assessment Program(NCAP) in that its tests are offset. The NHTSA standards require vehicles to provide no injuries to occupants after a head-on impact into a fixed barrier at 30 mph (48 km/h), not at an angle.[7]The IIHS test exposes 40% of the front of the vehicle to an impact with a deformable barrier at approximately 40 mph (64 km/h). This offset test represents approximately 0.04% of all car crashes and \"is the equivalent of running a vehicle into a parked car at 75 mph (121 km/h).[7]\n",
      "As with the NHTSA's frontal impact test, vehicles across different weight categories may not be directly compared. This is because the heavier vehicle is generally considered to have an advantage if it encounters a lighter vehicle or is involved in a single-vehicle crash. The IIHS demonstrated this by crashing three midsize sedans with three smaller \"Good\" rated minicars. The three minicars were rated \"Poor\" in these special offset head-on car-to-car tests in 2009, while the midsize cars rated \"Good\" or \"Acceptable\".[8]\n",
      "In December 2022 the IIHS updated the moderate overlap test to include a secondcrash test dummyseated behind the driver. The IIHS said that the advanced seat belt protections found in the front passenger seats, including crash tensioners and load limiters, should also exist in the rear passenger seats. Out of 15small SUVssubjected to the new test, nine received an overall rating of poor due to high rear passenger injury measurements to the head, neck and chest.[9]\n",
      "On August 14, 2012, IIHS released the first results for a new test, called the \"small overlap front test.\" The new test, which is used in addition to the 40% offset test introduced in 1995, subjects only 25% of the front end of the vehicle to a 40 mph impact against a solid, rounded-off barrier. As a result, it is far more demanding on the vehicle structure than the 40% offset test. In the first round of tests, composed of 11 midsized luxury and near-luxury vehicles, most vehicles did poorly; only three vehicles received \"good\" or \"acceptable\" ratings.[10]\n",
      "The rating system is similar to the 40% offset, but has some key differences: hip/thigh and lower leg/foot ratings replace individual ratings for each leg and foot, and a full score cannot be attained without deployment of front and side curtain airbags (due to the severe side movement often resulting from this test).[11]\n",
      "AMedical College of Wisconsinstudy found small-overlap collisions result in increased head, chest, spine, hip, and pelvis injuries. This sort of collision is common on two-lane roads with two-way traffic where a center median is absent. Single vehicle crashes (into a tree or a pole) account for 40% of small-overlap crashes.[12]According to the IIHS, 25% of frontal crash deaths are due to small overlap crashes, with the outer front wheel first to receive the impact forces rather than the more central crash absorbing structure.[13]\n",
      "The IIHS has since tested family cars,[14]compact cars,[15][16]minicars,[17]small[18]and midsized[19][20]SUVs, minivans,[21]muscle cars[22]and large pickup trucks[23]through the small-overlap test.\n",
      "In 2017, the IIHS began conducting this test on the passenger side of vehicles.\n",
      "The IIHS introduced the side impact test in 2003. In this test, the test vehicle remains stationary while a four-wheeled sled, with a deformable barrier attached, strikes the side of the vehicle at 31 mph (50 km/h). This test is used to simulate the impact of a high-riding pickup or SUV on the subject vehicle.\n",
      "In 2019, the IIHS modified the test by using a heavier sled, changing the barrier design, and increasing the impact speed from 31 to 37 mph (60 km/h). The IIHS cited the original test being unrealistic as the main reason for the modification.[24]This modified side test officially began in 2021. Out of 20 small SUVs tested in the new, tougher side impact tests, only one received a Good rating. In May 2022, the IIHS officially completed its test for the tougher, side crash test on 18 midsize SUVs. Ten midsize SUVs earned good ratings, two more with Acceptable ratings, and six with marginal overall ratings.[25][26]\n",
      "In the United States rollovers accounted for nearly 25% of passenger vehicle fatalities.  Features such aselectronic stability controlare proven to significantly reduce rollovers andlane departure warning systemsmay also help.  Rollover sensingside curtain airbagsalso help to minimize injuries in the event of a rollover.[27]\n",
      "In the test, which was introduced in 2009, the vehicle rests on a platform while a hydraulic metal plate diagonally pushes on the roof area above the side windows. In order to get the highest rating, the vehicle must withstand a force equivalent to at least four times itscurb weightbefore collapsing 5 in (130 mm).[28]\n",
      "In 2009, the IIHS celebrated its 50th anniversary. To illustrate how much automotive safety has progressed in five decades, IIHS tested a 1959Chevrolet Bel Aircrashing head-on, 40% offset with a 2009Chevrolet Malibuat 40 mph.[29]It put the video of the crash on the Internet and \"the results were no surprise to anyone with a passing familiarity with cars.\"[30]The Bel Air's occupant compartment was extensively damaged by the crash. Coupled with the car's lack of modern safety features such as airbags andseat belts, this resulted in the crash test dummy in the Bel Air recording forces that would have probably caused fatal injuries to a real driver. They \"would not only hit the inside of the car and experience a large (and damaging acceleration) but the car would smash you on the inside.\"[31]Sophisticated engineering and high-strength steel give modern vehicles a huge advantage.[29]\n",
      "This tests the vehicle's driver seat to determine effectiveness of the head restraints.[32]The driver's seat is placed on a sled to mimic rear-end collisions at 20 mph. Rear-end collisions at low to moderate speeds typically do not result in serious injuries but they are common.[33]In 2005 the IIHS estimated 25% of medical costs were related to whiplash injuries.\n",
      "In this test, an engineer drives the test car toward a rolling, cushioned box, which is used to simulate an actual car. The ratings, \"basic\", \"advanced\", and \"superior\", are awarded depending on whether the front crash prevention system meets government criteria, and if the system can reduce the speed or avoid the collision at both 12 and 25 mph (19 and 40. km/h).[34]\n",
      "The IIHS runs this test in three different scenarios, each scenario having two different speeds for the tested vehicle.\n",
      "In March 2016, the IIHS released ratings for headlight performance. Their first test involved family cars, and most earned marginal or poor ratings. Only one vehicle, theToyota Prius V, earned a good rating when equipped with specific headlights.[36]The Institute evaluated headlights for small SUVs 4 months later, and none of the vehicles tested earn a good rating.[37]In October 2016, they released ratings for pickup trucks, and theHonda Ridgelinewas the only pickup to earn a good rating on the headlights test when equipped with specific headlights.[38]\n",
      "TheTop Safety Pick(TSP) is an annual award to the best-performing cars of the year. As of the latest revisions to the award requirements in February 2023, a vehicle must receive overall marks of \"Good\" in the moderate overlap front, driver-side small overlap front and passenger-side small overlap front tests, as well as the side test that was updated in 2021. Additionally, the headlight rating criteria across all trims of a vehicle must either be \"Good\" or \"Acceptable.\" Ratings for roof strength, head restraints and vehicle-to-vehicle front crash prevention were previously part of the overall TSP evaluation, but were removed in 2023 as nearly all vehicles tested performed well in these categories. TheTop Safety Pick+award (TSP+) is given to vehicles that meet all the criteria for aTop Safety Pickand perform well in the nighttime vehicle-to-pedestrian front crash test, where some crash prevention systems may struggle due to low light conditions.[39]\n",

      "Aninsurance brokeris anintermediarywho sells, solicits, or negotiatesinsuranceon behalf of a client for compensation. An insurance broker is distinct from aninsurance agentin that a broker typically acts on behalf of a client by negotiating with multiple insurers, while an agent represents one or more specific insurers under a contract.[1]\n",

      "In Australia, all insurance brokers are required under theFinancial Services Reform Act 2001[3]to be licensed by the federal government'sAustralian Securities and Investments Commission(ASIC).[4]Reputable and experienced insurance brokers in Australia will generally also hold additional qualifications such as a certificate or diploma infinancial serviceswhich requires the completion of in depth studies in a specific area, the most common being general insurance or insurance brokering.\n",
      "Within Australia there are also a number of industry bodies that issue professional accreditations to members that comply with best standards of professional practice and integrity and maintain up to date skills and knowledge. The two main accreditations are theAustralian and New Zealand Institute of Insurance and Finance(ANZIIF)[5]Certified Insurance Professional (CIP) and National Insurance Brokers Association (NIBA)[6]Qualified Practicing Insurance Broker (QPIB) qualifications.\n",
      "Dealing with an insurance broker as opposed to directly with an insurer is something many customers (particularly businesses) choose to do in Australia for reasons including: the ease of having the \"shopping around done for them\"; having the opportunity for premium funding which allows for larger insurance policies to be paid in installments rather than all at once; dealing with one broker for all policies from the car insurance to professionalindemnity insurancerather than dealing directly with several insurers; and, the ease of having claims managed by the broker who deals directly with the insurer on the client's behalf.\n",
      "In Canada, insurance brokers are regulated on a provincial and territorial basis.[1]Insurance brokers and insurance agents are licensed and regulated by the same entity in most of Canada; either an arms-length organization, such as the General Insurance Council ofSaskatchewan, or directly by a government body.[7]In some provinces, such asOntario, insurance brokers have self-governing bodies responsible for licensing and regulation.[8]\n",
      "Insurance brokerbecame a regulated term under theInsurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977,[9]which was designed to prevent firms holding themselves as brokers but in fact acting as representative of one or more favoured insurance companies. The term has no legal definition following the repeal of the 1977 Act. The sale of general insurance was regulated by theFinancial Services Authorityfrom 14 January 2005 until 31 March 2013 and by theFinancial Conduct Authoritysince 1 April 2013. Any person or firm authorized by the Authority can now call themselves an insurance broker.\n",
      "Insurance brokerage is largely associated withgeneral insurance(car, house etc.) rather thanlife insurance, although some brokers continued to provideinvestmentand life insurance brokerage until the onset of new regulation in 2001. This drove a more transparent regime, based predominantly on upfront negotiation of a fee for the provision of advice and/or services. This saw the splitting of intermediaries into two groups: general insurance intermediaries/brokers andindependent financial advisers(IFAs) for life insurance, investments andpensions.\n",
      "General insurance brokering is carried out today by many types of authorized organisations including traditionalhigh streetbrokers and telephone or web-based firms.\n",
      "TheBritish Insurance Brokers' Associationis a representative organisation for brokers in the UK. It has over 1800 members.[10]\n",
      "In theUnited States, insurance brokers are regulated by individual states. Most states require anyone who sells, solicits, or negotiates insurance in that state to obtain an insurance broker license, with certain limited exceptions. This includes a business entity, the business entity's officers or directors (the \"sublicensees\" through whom the business entity operates), and individual employees.  In order to obtain a broker's license, a person typically must take pre-licensing courses and pass an examination.  An insurance broker also must submit an application (with an application fee) to the state insurance regulator in the state in which the applicant wishes to do business, who will determine whether the insurance broker has met all the state requirements and will typically do abackground checkto determine whether the applicant is considered trustworthy and competent.  A criminal conviction, for example, may result in a state determining that the applicant is untrustworthy or incompetent.  Some states also require applicants to submit fingerprints.\n",
      "Once licensed, an insurance broker generally must takecontinuing educationcourses when their licenses reach a renewal date.  For example, the state ofCaliforniarequires license renewals every 2 years, which is accomplished by completing continuing education courses.  Most states have reciprocity agreements whereby brokers from one state can become easily licensed in another state.  As a result of the federalGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, most states have adopted uniform licensing laws, with 47 states being deemed reciprocal by theNational Association of Insurance Commissioners.  A state may revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew an insurance broker's license if at any time the state determines (typically after notice and a hearing) that the broker has engaged in any activity that makes him untrustworthy or incompetent.\n",
      "Because of industry regulation, smaller brokerage firms can easily compete with larger ones, and in most states, all insurance brokers generally are forbidden by law from providing their customers with rebates or inducements.\n",
      "Insurance brokers play a significant role in helping companies and individuals procure property andcasualty (liability) insurance,life insuranceandannuities, and accident andhealth insurance.  For example, research shows that brokers play a significant role in helping small employers find health insurance, particularly in more competitive markets. Average small group commissions range from two percent to eight percent of premiums.  Brokers provide services beyond procuring insurance, such as providing risk assessments, insurance consulting services, insurance-related regulatory and legislative updates, claims assistance services, assisting with employee enrollment, and helping to resolve benefit issues.[11]However, some states consider the provision of services that are unrelated to the insurance procured through the broker to be an impermissible rebate or inducement.\n",
      "Negligenceon the part of insurance brokers can have severe effects upon clients when they discover their insurance coverage is worthless. In one case, Near North Entertainment Insurance Services providedalternative rockbandThird Eye Blindwith acommercial general liability(CGL) insurance policy that excluded coverage for the \"entertainment business\".  After insurance coverage for a lawsuit was denied because Third Eye Blind was and is, after all, in the entertainment business, theCalifornia Court of Appealruled in a published opinion that a subsequent court ruling establishing that the insurer had wrongfully denied coverage—that the insurer had a duty to defend the band and had breached that duty—did not absolve the broker of its duty to advise the band it needed something more than a basic CGL policy (namely,errors and omissions insurance).[12][13]\n",
      "In 2004,Eliot Spitzerfound apparent cases ofbid-riggingby the major brokers, where the brokers arranged with insurers to provide \"fake\" quotes in exchange for providing favorable risks amidst contingent commission arrangements.[14]In 2008,AIGpaid $125 million to settle with 9 states.[15]\n",
      "In most states there is no requirement to disclose the commission of the broker to the customer, but inNew York, a regulation (\"Regulation 194\") was adopted in 2011 which required disclosure.[16]Brokers or agents may decide to reveal their commission upon request.[17]\n",
      "In most states, agents cannot charge a fee in addition to their commission, althoughTexasis one of the exceptions.[18]\n",
      "Though not an absolute separation; aninsurance agentis an insurance company's representative by way ofagent-principallegal custom.  The agent's primary alliance is with the insurance carrier, not the insurance buyer.  In contrast, an insurance broker represents the insured, generally has no contractual agreements with insurance carriers, and relies on common or direct methods of perfecting business transactions with insurance carriers.  This can have a significant beneficial impact on insurance negotiations obtained through a broker (vs. those obtained from an agent).\n",
      "Any person acting as an insurance agent or broker must be licensed to do so by the state or jurisdiction that the person is operating in.  Whereas states previously would issue separate licenses for agents and brokers, most states now issue a single producer license regardless if the person is acting on behalf of the insured or insurer.  The terminsurance producersis used to reference both insurance agents and brokers.\n",
      "As in many industries, there is a trend towarddisintermediationwhere consumers buy directly from the insurer without an intermediary. However, the $46 billion[19]onlinevehicle, home, and life insurance markets for retail consumers have accelerated since 2012, with the rise of insurance comparison websites.[20]Publicly traded companies Amazon,[21]Walmart,[22]and Google[23]continue to disrupt how consumers purchase insurance with varying success.

In 1928 the Indian Insurance Companies Act was enacted to enable the government to collect statistical information about life- and non-life-insurance business conducted in India by Indian and foreign insurers, including provident insurance societies. In 1938 the legislation was consolidated and amended by the Insurance Act, 1938, with comprehensive provisions to control the activities of insurers.\n",

It arrived as a legacy of British occupation, with its roots in the 1850 establishment of the Triton Insurance Company in Calcutta. In 1907 the Indian Mercantile Insurance was established, the first company to underwrite all classes of general insurance. In 1957 the General Insurance Council (a wing of the Insurance Association of India) was formed, framing a code of conduct for fairness and sound business practice.\n",

The committee submitted its report in 1994, recommending that the private sector be permitted to enter the insurance industry. Foreign companies should enter by floating Indian companies, preferably as joint ventures with Indian partners.\n",
      "Following the recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, in 1999 the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) was constituted to regulate and develop the insurance industry and was incorporated in April 2000.
