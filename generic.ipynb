For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.', 'We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.', 'If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We will also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.', 'We also make various policies, help centres, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services.
